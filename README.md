# Module-10-Challenge

## Description

- This code displays a Team Profile Generator.
- I wanted to create a template to generate a team for projects.
- I coded JavaScript using the Inquirier package through Node, and I used Jest for testing.
- Given more time I would style the output page more.

## Installation

On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository. Above the list of files, click 'Code'. Click 'Open with GitHub Desktop' to clone and open the repository. Follow the prompts in GitHub Desktop to complete the clone. Open the code in your code editor. Open a new terminal, navigate to the root of the directory and run 'npm install'. Test using jest by running 'npm test'.
